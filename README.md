********
Place anything here as idea for anyone else to see.

We can use this palce to delineate tasks for the week and show progress. 

Anything else, like actually describe what the project does should probably go here as well. 

To get started open visual studio and select the clone or checkout code option and supply the repo - https://github.com/jrserb/CMSC495_WorkOut

Then restore the SQL database backup file in your sql server localdb. This will create the database and everything in it.

The project should work when you run it.
